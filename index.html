                    <h3>Personal Intro</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m Kenyon. I am 3rd generation native Arizonan. During my childhood years, I grew up in a little community in Mesa called Lehi. 
                        In my teenage years, I grew up in Queen Creek. Now I live in San Tan Valley with my wife and 3 kids. 7, 5 and 8 months.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life. The gospel really came alive for me after my family moved to Queen Creek. 
                        I supposed that’s when I became “converted”. This area and its people have been a huge blessing to me and my family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I served my mission at the Mesa Family History Center. There I learned to help others find their ancestors, work on and with computers. 
                        My mission changed the entire course of my life. Prior to my mission, I wanted to be a K-9 cop. But thanks to the skills I learned on 
                        my mission, IT was the field I got into. My Major is Software Development. I enjoy the integration of the gospel into secular learning here at BYU-I.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have many hobbies and interests. They currently are Legos, programming, woodworking, gaming and A Cappella (listening and singing). 
                        I enjoy all things Star Trek, Star Wars and Stargate. My favorite food is pizza. I am an introvert and I like being one (most of the time).
