                        <p>
                            In 2013 I began to work for Nationwide Insurance as a contract Personal Computer Tech (PCT). 
                            I excelled so well that within 6 months I became a fulltime employee. I continued to develop 
                            my skills in PC and Mac repair and troubleshooting. I quickly became a top performer in my 
                            team with performance reviews scored at 4 or 5 out of 5 every year. My primary responsibilities 
                            as senior analyst at Nationwide was to work on systems as we received tickets for them. In 
                            addition to that a wrote technical documents and knowledge base articles, participated in 
                            numerous projects and to deep dive system problems within the environment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My responsibility soon shifted from PC repair to automation. I began to create and script 
                            tools to automate maintenance and repair of systems and create fixes for known issues. 
                            There are two major projects I spearheaded that stand out. First was a project to automate 
                            the submission of request tickets. This saved the company $64,000 annually. The second was 
                            to correct an issue with launching Microsoft office. This saved the company $800,000 annually.
