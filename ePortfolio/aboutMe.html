                    <h3>About Me<h3>
                        <p>
                            Since I was young, I have always been interested in computers. However, I didn’t consider computing a 
                            career until my first computer job. It was a 1-year volunteer position at the Mesa Regional Family History 
                            Center. They just threw me into the IT department, to support the Center’s workstations. I had to learn 
                            quickly how to maintain them. It was a lot of manual PC work, so I created scripts to automate my daily tasks. 
                            That was my first taste at programming of any kind. I liked it.</p>
                        <p>
                            Later I would go on to work for the Geek Squad. It was a fast paced, high stress PC repair job. But I did very well and 
                            lasted much longer than most other techs. It was during this time that I went back to school to get a degree with a major 
                            in Cyber Security. However, when I did my first programming class, I fell in love with coding and I knew this was the 
                            direction I wanted to go. In 2013 I started working for Nationwide Insurance on the Personal Computer Technician (PCT) 
                            team supporting Nationwide’s tens of thousands of PC and Mac users. I excelled. I began to use my scripting and 
                            programming skills to automate my work. Also during this time, I transferred my credits to BYU-Idaho to finish 
                            my B.S. in Software Development. While at BYU-I I quickly picked up new skills in C++, C#, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, 
                            with Java being my most experienced language. While at BYU-I I have created many apps and websites showcasing 
                            my skills. It’s been a blast.</p>
                        <p>
                            I hope this portfolio shows you a sense of the skills I have and how I have applied them.</p>
