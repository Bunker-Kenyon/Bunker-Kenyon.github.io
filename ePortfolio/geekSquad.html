                            Geek Squad was a trial by fire. It was fun but high stress. I had to be both a 
                            PC repair technician and salesperson. Here I honed my customer service skills and 
                            PC/Mac repair skills. To keep up with the ever-changing consumer electronics world, 
                            it was a face paced learning environment. I was constantly in training of some kind. 
                            Here I also had my first taste of leadership. I was the lead tech. I had to train 
                            new techs, coach, and go over metrics with employees. I also participated in many 
                            pilot or test programs to see if a particular new strategy would work. Of the 12 techs 
                            we had I consistently brought in 50% or more of the revenue for the tech bench. 
                            My Geek Squad was #2 out of 150+ locations in the nation. Although I find some aspect 
                            of sales and customer service stressful, I am good at it. My secret is honesty and kindness.
