                        <p>
                            This was my first professional job as a PC tech. It was volunteer for a year. 
                            When I first started at the family history center, I did not know I would be in the IT department. 
                            I was assigned there after my training was complete. I fell in love with working with computers. 
                            The work required daily hands on for the computer systems. Since the family history 
                            center was like a library, we had to make sure the systems were scrubbed of personal data at 
                            the end of every day. When I started there, we had no automation for this. I didnâ€™t like having 
                            to do everything manually for 150+ systems every day, so I created a script that would run every 
                            night to automate all the work. I also participated in a refresh project. Many of the systems were 
                            of different ages and specs. We wanted everything to be uniform. So, we ordered replacement systems 
                            of all the same brand and specs to further reduce workload.
